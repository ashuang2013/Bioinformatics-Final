You tell Dr. Kim about the potential breach in the gut part of the database. He is very visibly worried. <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to a certain study published about 5 years ago, the gut microbiome produced the most stable and accurate results when sampling and identifying unique individuals when compared to the skin data that we collected. Additionally, the fact that he stole older data doesn't matter since gut microbiome data stays constant about 30-300 days after collection," explained Dr. Kim. <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either way, we need to report this to IRB and the police as soon as possible. You made the correct decision to tell me!" said Dr. Kim. <br/>
