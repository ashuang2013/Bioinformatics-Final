You are a proud graduate of MIT's class of 2020 with a BS in Bioinformatics. You just landed a job as a research assistant on the Human Microbiome Project due to your impressive resume. You are currently working to compile some shotgun metagenomic samples that just came from the lab using samtools. The head researcher Dr. Kim is on lunch break when the phone suddenly rings. You are startled and look around the room; there is nobody there but you. You hesitantly pick up the phone. <br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello?" you hesitantly ask. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello," says a distorted voice. "I have just hacked your databases and have copied the data. The microbiome data is very interesting, it looks very valuable alongside the sequenced reads you are currently compiling. I want 100 million USD in two days, I will email you some evidence. Reply by tonight at 7PM sharp or I release the compiled information on the internet. It will be interesting...*pause* All your participants will suddenly have their entire private genetic information read by the Internet...*pause* I wonder how that will feel?" the hacker suddenly hangs up with a resounding *click*. <br/>

A second after the phone call ended, an email pops up in your inbox. <br/><br/>
xxx@email.com <br/>
to me <br/><br/>

You will find the attached information below. <br/>
You have until 7PM. <br/><br/>

L <br/><br/>

What should you do? <br/>
[Tell Dr. Kim when he comes back from lunch break](https://ashuang2013.github.io/Bioinformatics-Final/Scenario1) <br/>
[Ignore L,  what is he going to do with de-identified participant information plus microbiome data? He's obviously bluffing](https://ashuang2013.github.io/Bioinformatics-Final/Scenario2)<br/>
