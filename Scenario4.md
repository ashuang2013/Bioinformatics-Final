You tell Dr. Kim about the potential breach in the skin part of the database. He is worried but not too much. <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to a certain research paper published about 5 years ago, the skin microbiome produced the less stable and accurate results when sampling and identifying unique individuals," explained Dr. Kim. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It could be worse, in the same study, the gut bacteria microbiome had a significantly higher chance of actually identifying the participants. However, since the data that he stole is not recent and taking into consideration the fact that our skin microbiomes live in an acidic environment and change readily with physical contact with surfaces, there should not be a big risk in a breach of privacy," said Dr. Kim. <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either way, we need to report this to ISB and the police as soon as possible. You made the correct decision to tell me!" said Dr. Kim. <br/>
