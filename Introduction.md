# Ethical and Privacy Ramifications in Personal Microbiome Environments

## A History <br/>
The Human Genome Project (1990-2003) was a international, collaborative research program that aimed to sequence the entire human genome. The results squenced about 20,500 human genes and about 3 billion DNA nucleotides (about 99% of the human genome) to an accuracy of 99.99%. The Human Genome project also identified more than 3 mlilion human genetic variations (SNPs[add review here]). <br/>

The sequencing of the human genome is an amazing feat, but brings with it its own ethical and privacy ramifications.
