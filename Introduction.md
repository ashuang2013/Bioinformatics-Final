# Introduction to the Privacy Ramifications in Personal Microbiome Sequencing

## A History
### Human Genome Project
The Human Genome Project (1990-2003) was a international, collaborative research program that aimed to sequence the entire human genome. The results squenced about 20,500 human genes and about 3 billion DNA nucleotides (about 99% of the human genome) to an accuracy of 99.99%. The Human Genome project also identified more than 3 million human genetic variations (SNPs[add review here]). <br/>

The sequencing of the human genome also brings with it its own privacy ramifications. The most important and thereby solved problem is protecting the data of the participants in studies. This is accomplished by de-identifying participant data when releasing results. Alongside other acts like GINA (while outdated), participants can rest easy in their anonymity when participating in studies. This is trust of confidentiality is important in furthering research.
