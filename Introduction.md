# Introduction to the Privacy Ramifications in Personal Microbiome Sequencing

## A History
### Human Genome Project
The Human Genome Project (1990-2003) was a international, collaborative research program that aimed to sequence the entire human genome<sup>1</sup>. The results squenced about 20,500 human genes and about 3 billion DNA nucleotides (about 99% of the human genome) to an accuracy of 99.99%<sup>1</sup>. The Human Genome project also identified more than 3 million human genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms (abbreviated to SNPs)$^1$. <br/>

With increased collaboration between parties comes increased risks related to privacy. Much like single tandem repeats (STRs), SNPs bring with them the power to identify individuals. With enough SNPs (about 30-80 SNPs<sup>4</sup>), their overlaps can uniquely identify individuals. This potential to uniquely identify individuals brings by combining genome sequencing along with SNPs brings its own privacy ramifications. SNPs can "predict...physical traits, disease risk, demography, and [even] family history<sup>4</sup>." This important problem is solved through actions that protect the data of the participants in studies like de-identifying participant data when releasing results. Acts like [GINA](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Genetic-Discrimination) (while outdated), also serve to further protect the privacy of participants.

### Human Microbiome Project
According to the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), "the overall mission of the HMP was to generate resources to facilitate characterization of the human microbiota to further our understanding of how the microbiome impacts human health and disease<sup>6</sup>." While sequencing microbiome data inside human samples, researchers realized that the microbiobes that live inside our gut, skin, etc. are specific to each person even over long periods of time. 

In the study Identifying Personal Microbiomes using Metagenomic Codes, "the gut habitat (as represented by stool) produced the most stable codes across all feature types, with 86% TPs among marker-based codes<sup>4</sup>." This is compared to the skin, where are characterized by lower pH (higher acidity), which supports less diverse microbiome environments. Not only that, but regular skin contact also changes the microbiome environment with external microbiomes. This is shown in the data with "difference in temporal stability between the most and least abundant taxa was more extreme at skin and vaginal sites than in the oral cavity and gut (mean stability ratio of 3.4:1 vs. 1.8:1)<sup>4</sup>."

As stated above, SNPs can become a strong identifying tools to differentiate between individuals. With the correct databases, many of which are public online, it is possible to correctly identify an individual inside a group. Using the extrememly stable gut bacterial microbiome as the base, the study was able to pinpoint more than 80% of the participants in the study. This respectable number draws attention to microbiome environments as a way to potentially uniqely identify individuals (like SNP). One niche would be to identify between identical twins, who both have the same DNA since they are two halves of the same zygote<sup>9</sup>.
