You delete the email and continue compiling the samtools data from the lab. You become more and more engrossed in your work. By the time you get off work at 5:30PM, you have completely forgotten about the email. You eat a nice dinner of spicy ramen noodles plus last night's leftovers. <br/>

Tomorrow morning, you wake up at 6:30AM and turn on the news. A horrifying sight greets you: <br/>

__*BREAKING NEWS: Hundreds of Participants' Personal Information Leaked from a Lab Related to Human Microbiome Project*__ <br/><br/>
At around 7PM last night, an notorious hacker named L released private identifying information on about 100 participants in one lab affiliated with the Human Microbiome Project on several social media platforms including but not excluding Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Instagram. It is unknown whether L also uploaded the private information on to the dark web as well. The potential ramifications associated with this breach of privacy is massive, making waves through the entire scientific community, breaking the trust in confidentiality between participant and researchers along with severe HIPPA and GINA violations. <br/>

Currently, this matter is being investigated by the police and has been reported to the IRB. The lab and the head researcher Dr. Kim had this to say about the matter: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We had no knowledge of this situation. I am just as confused as the public in how and why we were targeted by the notorious L as a small lab. I hope that the police investigation can clear up any misunderstandings in this situation." <br/>

Right now, the participants in the study are extrememly upset and panicked. This is a big bombshell to the participants and their families. Back to you Jim. <br/>
